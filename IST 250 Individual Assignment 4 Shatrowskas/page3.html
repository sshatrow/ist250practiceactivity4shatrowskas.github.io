<p>Mark was not in the band for long, only being a member for a brief time in 1984.  He played on the Animalize album and played a 
    couple of shows for that album's tour, but was subsequently let go.  Reasons for his departure and lack of shows range from
    health problems to not getting along with other band members.  
    His short tenure is perhaps why he is not as well remembered as the others.  
    Mark passed away in 2007.
