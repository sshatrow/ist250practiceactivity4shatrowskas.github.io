<h1>Selling my Amiga 500 Collection</h1>
<img src="IMG_1045.JPEG" alt="Amiga 500 with extras" width="320" height="240">
<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is with great sadness that I have to sell my <b>Amiga 500</b> collection.
        The tuition bill is due and I have no other options.
        The computer itself is in great physical condition, everything works.
        Power supply is included along with software and an external floppy drive.
    </p>
    <p>I have also included some software, a mix of games and utilities.
        This software is <i>disk only</i> and will come in two floppy disk holders.
        Two video adapters will be included.
        One is Commodore branded and will let you use this Amiga on a TV with RF or composite video inputs.
        The other is an after-market adapter that will let you use the Amiga on a VGA monitor.
        Also included is a disk that will let you switch between NTSC and PAL video modes.
    </p>
