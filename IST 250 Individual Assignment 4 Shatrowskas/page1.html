<p>Also known as "Space Ace", Ace Frehley was Kiss' original lead guitarist.  Some of the classic albums he played on include:
    <ul id="albums">
        <li>Dressed to Kill</li>
        <li>Destroyer</li>
        <li>Dynasty</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>He played with the band from its founding in 1973 until 1982, when he quit due to not liking the direction the band was going in.  
He rejoined for a brief period from 1996 to 2002, before once again quitting the band.  Ace is well loved by the fans and is deeply missed.
