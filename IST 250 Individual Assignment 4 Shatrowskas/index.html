<p>For this final assignemnt, I decided to make a web page talking about the five lead guitarists for the band Kiss.
    Kiss has been on my mind lately ever since Ace Frehley's passing.  When I saw the requirement to have at least five HTML pages, 
    I noticed that was the same number of lead guitarists in Kiss.  So, I have decided to make a dedicated page for each 
    one of them plus this home page and the contact form.
