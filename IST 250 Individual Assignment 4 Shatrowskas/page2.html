<p>Ah, Vinnie, aka The Ankh Warrior, one of the more eccentric of the Kiss guitarists.  Joining in 1982, he only lasted until 1984 when he was fired
    from the band due to not signing his contract and not being a team player in general.  He did not like being told what to do
    and was infamous for his long solos at shows.  Still, he did help write classics such as the song "Lick it Up" and even 
    wrote with the band once again in the 90s, such as on the song "Unholy."  Albums that Vinnie played on include:

    <ul id="albums">
        <li>Creatures of the Night</li>
        <li>Lick it Up</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>His reputation among the fans is mixed.  Some praise him for his songwriting, others dismiss him as a joke.</p>

<p>Here are some songs that he is most associated with, either as a writer or as a performer:
