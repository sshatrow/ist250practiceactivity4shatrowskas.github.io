<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
<p class="Story">Founded in 1999 by an eccentric rail enthusiast, Railroad St Game Studios has been fulfilling the desires of gamers.
    Our first project, 2001's "Subway Maker", was a modest success and ever since we have strived to be bigger and getter with each new game.
    We even branched out into different genres such as in 2009's horror/sim crossover game "Haunted Railroad Simulator 2009" and 2011's "Pinball Express" where players had to drive the train using a pinball table.
